# Revamping Health Insurance Using Quantum Cryptography Based Blockchain

This system efficiently stores, accesses, and retrieves
patient data and eases the process of health insurance
using Blockchain, where the blockchain data is
encrypted using Post-Quantum Cryptography encryption and then
hash is generated using QHC256 to make it resistant to quantum
attack.




## Features

- To facilitate the exchange of health insurance information between numerous parties, including hospital staff, lab workers, and patients.
- To keep patient data accurate when transferred across facilities.
- Creating, storing, and gaining access to patient data on the blockchain network effectively.
- To make purchasing medications or drugs from pharmacies simpler.
- To keep up access controls and authentication for medical records utilising blockchain-based smart contracts.
- Instead of using the SHA256 Hashing Algorithm, the QHC256 post-quantum cryptography is employed to improve the security of the data on the conventional blockchain.
- To create a quantum attack-resistant ideal algorithm.
